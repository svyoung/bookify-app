## About Bookify

Bookify allows users to search for books and organize them to their "To Read"/"Read" lists. It uses React and TypeScript. There is no database, and refreshing the page will erase all data. Third-party API queries from Open Library and does not require an authentication key.

#### Features include:
- Search for books
- Add a book to the "To Read" list/tab
- Clicking a book's title will automatically search for a book with the same title
- Clicking on a book's author name will automatically search for books by the author
- Clicking on any book's subject will automatically search for books in that subject
- "To Read" books could be deleted or marked "Done" with a trashcan and checkmark icon
- "Read" tab lists will show books that have been marked completed

#### Features to be included:
- Sorting lists
- Search within lists
- Categories label option

Bookify is currently only built for a desktop view.
