## About Bookify

This is a simple app for a book search + adding books to a "To Read" list using React and TypeScript. There is no database, and refreshing the page will erase all data. Third-party API queries from Open Library and does not require authentication key.

#### Functionality includes:
- Search for books
- Add a book to the "To Read" list/tab
- Clicking a book's title will automatically search for a book with the same title
- Clicking on a book's author name will automatically search for books by the author
- Clicking on any book's subject will automatically search for books in that subject
- "To Read" books could be deleted or marked "Done" with a trashcan and checkmark icon
- "Read" tab lists will show books that have been marked completed

Bookify is currently only built for a desktop view.
